/* SimpleNewton provides a simple **minimization** routine for
 * convex functions with equality constraints based on the Newton step
 * with infeasible start and elimination.
 *
 * Suppose we like to minimize f(x) subject to Ax = b, where f is convex.
 * The Newton step with infeasible start is defined as:
 *
 *   [ D^2 f(x) | A^T ]  [ step ]   [ D f(x) ]
 *   [----------+-----]  [------] = [--------]                (eq:step)
 *   [    A     |  0  ]  [ dual ]   [ Ax - b ]
 *
 * and then the new x is defined as
 *
 *   x <- x + t*step
 *
 * where parameter t is obtained usually via backtracking line search.
 * Instead of solving equation (eq:step) we use substitution. For simplicity
 * we rewrite the above as two equations where H = D^2 f(x) and h = D f(x):
 *
 *   H step + A^T dual = -g,   A step = -h
 *
 * and solve for step:
 *
 *   step = - H^(-1) (g + A^T dual)
 *   A H^(-1) (g + A^T dual) = h
 *
 * thus letting S = - A H^(-1) A^T we get
 *
 *   S dual = A H^(-1) g - h
 *   H step = -A^T dual - g
 *
 * This is particularly useful, because in our setting (interior point method)
 * matrix H is diagonal, thus H^(-1) is easy to calculate and S is sparse.
